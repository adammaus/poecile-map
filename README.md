# Overview
* A simple visualization of the contact zone between Black-capped Chickadees and Carolina Chickadees.
* Also plots locations of last 30 iNaturalist observations of Poecile (Chickadees) that Need ID and an account has not reviewed. To use an account, fill in the `viewer_id` variable in map.html.
* Includes a measurement tool to help in determining distance between observation and contact zone. Carolina Chickadees are moving north at a rate of 1km/year [1] and this contact zone is from 2020 [2].

[1] Found in McQuillan et al. 2015. "Second, the hybrid zone is moving rapidly northward at a rate of approximately 10 km/decade, with P. carolinensis moving into territory historically occupied by P. atricapillus and displacing them (Bronson et al. 2003a; Reudink et al. 2007; Taylor et al. 2014a)."

# TODOs
* Add input for an iNaturalist URL that will pull an observation's location and place it on the map
* Update popups with more features - picture, better species name support in title, etc
* UX improvements - hide zoom button under measure button, load more observations, hide points, etc
